      <p class="HeroIntro">
        This journey has been challenging, especially coming in with no background in 
        JavaScript. HTML and CSS felt like brushing up on my skills, but JavaScript was 
        like learning a whole new language filled with many obstacles. Over the last three 
        months, I’ve learned a lot, and while I still have far to go, looking at my 
        progress makes me proud. Working on this daily and applying it to my current 
        role, such as when building Cloud Pages and understanding what JavaScript is 
        instructing, has been a big step forward.
